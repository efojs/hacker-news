A normal blood pressure is less than 130&#x2F;85.High blood pressure is 140&#x2F;90 or higher. If your blood pressure is between 120&#x2F;80 and 140&#x2F;90, then you have prehypertension.

It is a fictitious story about a group of middle-class young people living in Seattle. They lead a typical millennial lifestyle, which is mostly comprised of working tech jobs during the day and playing computer games during the night. The purpose of the book is to address the spiritual, religious and meaning-of-life questions in the context of the new and popular simulation theory movement.<p>Many serious authors, philosophers, entrepreneurs and scientists contributed to further development of the Simulation Hypothesis movement. A lot of emphases is currently being put on proving or disproving the hypothesis. Human imagination generates countless variations of the world outside of our simulation. Recently published book by Riz Virk \u201cThe Simulation Hypothesis\u201d lists many possible reasons for our world&#x27;s simulation existence. People have a reasonable question once they assume that they live in a simulation and they are not much different from the characters in someone&#x27;s cruel game: \u201cWhat is the meaning of life if we are just game characters?\u201d \u201cAnswers In Simulation\u201d book tries to philosophically demonstrate that the nature of simulation doesn&#x27;t matter and provides answers to the meaning of life and God&#x27;s role questions. The book proves that those answers will stay true regardless of the reason for the original simulation creation.<p>The book leaves readers with a positive and optimistic view of life. The book praises science and technology as the way out of suffering. Book clearly shows that it is possible to consolidate science and religion via the Simulation Hypothesis.", "time": 1567362094, "title": "Simulation Hypothesis is a missing link to consolidate science

OpenZones are regions covering disaster zones where all the pro data in the app is freely available.<p>I have created an 1200km diameter OpenZone over Florida with Hurricane Dorian approaching. So if you add Florida to the app, you can view radar, NOAA&#x27;s GFS, NAM and HRRR models, CMC GDPS and RDPS models, and the DWD (Germany) ICON model. There are also predicted hurricane tracks from the NOAA and CMC ensemble models which I find extremely valuable to predict the possible paths of Dorian. This YouTube video[1] shows an example of the hurricane tracks.<p>The reasoning behind OpenZones is that meteorological organizations solve weather simulations and release data to the public with the aim to reduce damage, injury and fatalities. It&#x27;s only right to support this purpose and open up all data in disaster zones.<p>The idea for OpenZones came from the fires (Camp Fire) in California last year. I was part way through adding HRRR smoke simulation data to Flowx when a user asked if I could release the smoke data early for the California fires.

Wing[1]. In it there was a section about how it was used in daily life. Here are a few examples:<p>Hashing. After a talk I gave at a department faculty meeting on my computational thinking vision, Danny Sleator came up to tell me that at his home they use a particular hashing function to store away Lego pieces. According to Sleator, they hash on these categories: rectangular thick blocks, other thick (non-rectangular) blocks, thins (of any shape), wedgies, axles, rivets and spacers, fits on axle, ball and socket, and miscellaneous. They even have rules to classify pieces that could fit into more than one category. He said that \u201cEven though this is pretty crude, it saves about a factor of 10 when looking for a piece.\u201d Avrim Blum overheard Danny telling me this story and chimed in to say \u201cAt our home, we use a different hash function.\u201d<p>Sorting. The following story is taken verbatim from an email sent by Roger Dannenberg, a professional trumpeter and computer scientist. \u201cI showed up to a big band gig, and the band leader passed out books with maybe 200 unordered charts and a set list with about 40 titles we were supposed to get out and place in order, ready to play.

A Privacy Simulator where you get users, mine their data and sell those data to other people the main purpose was to educate people on how exactly data mining and data collection is being done by Tech Companies in a very easy and fun way. I posted the dev updates on the YouTube channel (you can still see the Devlogs), the first Devlog was posted on 5th of Nov 2018 (Later I realized that it shares the same theme with the V Movie and Guy Fawkes Holiday). I published the demo version on itch.io back in April of this year and someone donated with a message:<p>&quot;Keep up the good work. I&#x27;m a cybersecurity instructor and we are always looking for more tools to teach privacy and security (especially multiplayer games) so it&#x27;s good to see something like this being made&quot;<p>And I later realized that being just a game was not enough. I did this whole research thing on privacy, blockchain and decentralization. I have invested a few on altcoins a while back in 2018 and most of them did not see the light of the day, I saw the problem.<p>I have curated Privacy focused news, apps and services so you can just go to these sites in one click. Apologies if you are experiencing some technical difficulties, it&#x27;s still in alpha stage but I am planning to improve it.<p>I have included two call to action buttons at the bottom to support and improve the Privasim.

Cristina, Maria, Radu and Alex, co-founders of Listle (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.listle.io\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.listle.io</a>). We provide audio versions of articles. Instead of sitting in front of your computer reading your favourite blogs or news articles, you can listen to them while you commute, run or cook.<p>While being in YC over the last three months, we\u2019ve developed both the iOS and Android apps. You can find these here: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;listle.app.link&#x2F;m2DbuzvEDZ\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;listle.app.link&#x2F;m2DbuzvEDZ</a>.<p>We started this out while still being in university, back in London, a few months ago. The idea was born as a solution to the painful process of using crappy text-to-speech software to listen to articles on the commute to lectures. We used Instapaper, Pocket and open source solutions for text to speech, but none were great. We noticed that as much as technology has evolved, listening to a robotic voice for more than five minutes is still simply terrible.<p>The success of podcasts and audiobooks shows that people enjoy listening to content. However, most of the content out there is still in written format. Listle aims to bridge the gap between these two worlds and enable people to listen to any article on the Internet. For example, you can listen to Paul Graham\u2019s, Michael Seibel\u2019s and several other YC partners\u2019 articles. We\u2019re also actively partnering with independent authors and enabling them to distribute their content in audio, through an embedded player on their Medium page &#x2F; personal blog.

worked at a Canadian startup for just under 3 years. I signed a stock option agreement at the very beginning of 2017.<p>My understanding of private equity was:\nOver a scheduled period of time, options would be granted to me. These are shares in the company that can be purchased at my given strike price.<p>So a smart person would do either two things with their vested options:\n1. Purchase them, and then immediately sell them back if there is a positive spread.\n2. Ignore them because the spread is negative, making the options essentially worthless (unless you want to hold onto the shares for a year or more and hope the company goes back up in value. I&#x27;m taught that this is generally an awful idea.)<p>I&#x27;m hinting at some incomplete knowledge here because unlike a publicly traded company on a stock market, I&#x27;m not sure who would be purchasing the shares from me. I figure it would be either the startup themselves or the investors involved with the startup.<p>This is the curve ball:\n[When asking what the current value of a share is, in order to determine the spread] &quot;it was just re-evaluated to that new strike price. You don&#x27;t know the value until it goes public. It is a much better value now than it was previously so you are in a better position.&quot;<p>Current value re-evaluated to a strike price? This is a puzzling statement to me, but more importantly, I&#x27;m not allowed to know the value until the company goes public?? I find that to be very suspicious. I&#x27;m supposed to take my employer&#x27;s word that the spread exists? But I&#x27;m not allowed to know what it is?<p>My instincts are raising red flags. A good majority of my options vested but now I feel like I just have to forget about them. I was very sure that startup equity could be of tangible value even without the company being publicly listed on the TSE or NYSE or wherever.

Savings Plans provide you the flexibility to use the compute option that best suits your needs and automatically save money, all without having to perform exchanges or modifications. When you sign up for a Savings Plan, you will be charged the discounted Savings Plans price for your usage up to your commitment.<p>Savings Plans allow you to easily reduce your bill by making a commitment to compute usage (e.g. $10&#x2F;hour) instead of making commitments to specific instance configurations. AWS offers two types of Savings Plans - Compute Savings Plans and EC2 Instance Savings Plans.<p>Compute Savings Plans provide the most flexibility and help to reduce your costs by up to 66%. These plans automatically apply to EC2 instance usage regardless of instance family, size, AZ, region, OS or tenancy, and also apply to Fargate usage.<p>EC2 Instance Savings Plans provide the lowest prices, offering savings up to 72% in exchange for commitment to usage of individual instance families in a region (e.g. M5 usage in N. Virginia). This automatically reduces your cost on the selected instance family in that region regardless of AZ, size, OS or tenancy. EC2 Instance Savings Plans give you the flexibility to change your usage between instances within a family in that region.<p>Get started with Savings Plans by accessing your recommendations and customizing the plan type, payment option and term.", "time": 1573077743, "title": "AWS Savings Plans: New AWS cost management feature", "type": "story"}, "21467971": {"by": "frank_lbt", "descendants": 0, "id": 21467971, "score": 1, "time": 1573077787, "title": "Show HN: Discover new windows store apps easier", "type": "story", "url": "https://www.microsoft.com/p/app-rise/9mxt33zzccr1?cid=producthunt"}, "21467976": {"by": "MedicalJunkie", "dead": true, "id": 21467976, "score": 1, "time": 1573077809, "title": "Way to Break into Medical Device Sales \u2013 Medtechy", "type": "story", "url": "https://www.medtechy.com/articles/2019/the-best-way-to-break-into-medical-device-sales#.XcNDKvo4zQM.hackernews"}, "21467994": {"by": "nikitaame", "descendants": 8, "id": 21467994, "kids": [21468363, 21468173, 21469318, 21468610, 21468589], "score": 17, "text": "Apple takes great pride in their adherence to their core competency of protecting the user and their data.

Our experience with thousands of patients has helped to shape our approach and reinforce our belief that ground-breaking technology and human touch are both essential elements of truly transformative care.<p>Our values\nBe amazing at what you do, without ego.\nTake ownership and be accountable to yourself and the team.\nMove fast with our stakeholders&#x27; best interests at heart.\nBe open to a breadth of ideas, but focused on delivery.\nMeasure, reflect, and improve what really matters.\nBe candid and honest with people.\nDemonstrate high integrity, always.\nHelp others and appreciate those who help you.\nBe a decent human.\nHave fun.\nOur stack\nAWS \nGoogle Cloud\nReactNative\nMongoDB\nPostGreSQL\nKotlin \nClojure\nKubernetes, Knative<p>To apply e-mail Nayan (n@heartbeathealth.com)", "time": 1568988240, "title": "Heartbeat Health Is Hiring in NYC", "type": "story"}, "21026785": {"by": "cryptoctk", "descendants": 0, "id": 21026785, "score": 4, "time": 1568988269, "title": "How We Earned $10,120 in 30 Days: Kickstart of a Marketing Experiment", "type": "story", "url": "https://www.shitexpress.com/blog/how-we-earned-10120-usd-in-30-days-by-sending-horse-poop-to-people-amazing-kickstart-of-a-marketing-experiment/"}, "21026794": {"by": "indigodaddy", "descendants": 0, "id": 21026794, "score": 1, "time": 1568988328, "title": "ShellCMS \u2013 A Static Site Generator Content Management System", "type": "story", "url": "http://bkhome.org/shellcms/"}, "21026798": {"by": "bookofjoe", "descendants": 0, "id": 21026798, "score": 2, "time": 1568988351, "title": "Mysterious magnetic pulses discovered on Mars", "type": "story", "url": "https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/2019/09/mars-insight-feels-mysterious-magnetic-pulsations-at-midnight/"}, "21026808": {"by": "hsnewman", "descendants": 0, "id": 21026808, "score": 1, "time": 1568988425, "title": "New Biometrics", "type": "story", "url": "https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2019/09/new_biometrics.html"}, "21026810": {"by": "infodocket", "descendants": 0, "id": 21026810, "score": 1, "time": 1568988449, "title": "EPFL Develops Solution for Detecting Deepfakes", "type": "story", "url": "https://actu.epfl.ch/news/epfl-develops-solution-for-detecting-deepfakes/"}, "21026819": {"by": "pottereric", "descendants": 0, "id": 21026819, "score": 1, "time": 1568988499, "title": "Introduction to the Model View Update Pattern", "type": "story", "url": "https://elmprogramming.com/model-view-update-part-1.html"}, "21026827": {"by": "redman25", "descendants": 0, "id": 21026827, "score": 1, "time": 1568988549, "title": "Avoid Mutation \u2013 Functional Style in Ruby", "type": "story", "url": "https://www.rubypigeon.com/posts/avoid-mutation-functional-style-in-ruby/"}, "21026862": {"by": "vontzy", "descendants": 0, "id": 21026862, "score": 1, "time": 1568988715, "title": "The Mac Portable\u2013an Apple flop that led to great things\u2013turns 30", "type": "story", "url": "https://www.fastcompany.com/90406591/the-mac-portable-an-apple-flop-that-led-to-great-things-turns-30-today"}, "21026863": {"by": "octosphere", "descendants": 0, "id": 21026863, "score": 1, "time": 1568988718, "title": "Moonlight Maze", "type": "story", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moonlight_Maze"}, "21026871": {"by": "wglb", "descendants": 0, "id": 21026871, "score": 1, "time": 1568988765, "title": "Soccer at the Edge of the World", "type": "story", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/20/sports/greenland-soccer.html"}, "21026872": {"by": "mpelembe", "dead": true, "id": 21026872, "score": 1, "time": 1568988768, "title": "What Would Jesus Do?", "type": "story", "url": "http://wire.mpelembe.net/the-annual-gathering-of-the-kingdom-code-community/"}, "21026879": {"by": "matt_d", "descendants": 0, "id": 21026879, "score": 1, "time": 1568988805, "title": "\u201cBetter Code: Relationships\u201d -

No other magnifier I&#x27;ve tried on Windows and Linux can seem to match this.<p>- Assignable hotkeys to enlarge certain parts of the screen.

It seems like a lot of people in the industry are against getting a master&#x27;s degree as it can be expensive and of questionable value. As for myself, I have a few reasons that are motivating me:<p>1. Better employment opportunities outside of web development work: I am aware that some positions e.g. AI, ML are pretty much restricted to those with master&#x27;s or PhDs.<p>2. My undergraduate school was not the best in terms of education, and I would like to learn from a much better institution. Ideally, I would also assist with some research should my schedule permit it.<p>3. Self-interest: I enjoy computer science and would love to go deeper into several sub-fields (will likely do a thesis).<p>4. Reputation &#x2F; family: Growing up, my family did not really put much emphasis on education and intellectual curiosity, nor were they themselves relatively educated. I&#x27;d like to be one of the very few in my family to hold an advanced degree. It&#x27;s almost like a challenge to myself to see how much I can grow from my circumstances and previous self.<p>So, HN, what&#x27;s your take on this?

As a result, Amazon have closed my account, given a very vague justification of &quot;address verification&quot; and voided my entire balance.<p>I have called several times and have been led in circles on each occasion. When I was finally able to get through to a supervisor, he refused to give me the actual reason for my account closure and hung up after I repeatedly asked him to pass me to someone who could actually help resolve this situation.<p>I have filed a complaint with BBB, and emailed the second-line jeff@amazon.com address, but I&#x27;m not really holding out much hope for a reply &#x2F; resolution.<p>Fundamentally I am rather upset that I am being made to feel like a criminal, when in fact my order was perfectly legitimate. Most frustratingly I would happily provide proof that I reside at this address, if only I were afforded the opportunity to do so!

But for as much that this brings, a lot of things that just worked before are complicated.<p>I recently started a new personal project. I have started with my comfortable bottlepy sever with templates. But as the javascript becomes involved, more libraries seem to give examples in the ES6 style (imports etc), I think I need to think this through more.<p>My question is, in late 2019, if you want to keep your javascript simple, what are your options?

Work in QA automation and am very good at what I do (finding bugs), in charge of a QA team.  May have opportunity to work full remote and want to.  I am deaf but have a cochlear implant - I can talk and hear well for the most part.<p>I communicate OK with my colleagues while at home on a 1:1 basis, talking over Slack or a video call.  My weakness is in a group setting when I am remote.  If I am present in person at a group meeting, my chances of understanding everything enough to answer QA related questions or enforce a culture of quality is high.  While I am remote, it is hard to both raise my voice to get my words in and also very hard to understand everything people are saying in a group meeting.  Even without group meetings, my level of contribution is high - but others feel differently and frequently want to schedule meetings with me being present in person.

I&#x27;ve done a lot of DevOps-type work over the last year, and I&#x27;m getting my Kubernetes app developer cert shortly.<p>Thank you in advance!<p>*Edited for clarity.", "time": 1568209941, "title": "Ask HN: What's compensation like in the greater Boston area?", "type": "story"}, "20940200": {"by": "mrchichester", "descendants": 0, "id": 20940200, "score": 1, "time": 1568209947, "title": "Rand Fishkin Is Speaking at JumpCon 2019", "type": "story", "url": "https://jumpcrew.com/meet-rand-fishkin-jumpcon-2019-speaker/"}, "20940204": {"by": "iBelieve", "descendants": 0, "id": 20940204, "score": 1, "time": 1568209970, "title": "September Update: The PinePhone Is Real and Shipping Soon", "type": "story", "url": "https://www.pine64.org/2019/09/05/september-update-the-pinephone-is-real-shipping-soon/"}, "20940209": {"by": "artsandsci", "descendants": 0, "id": 20940209, "score": 1, "time": 1568210009, "title": "New York Times Dev Portal", "type": "story", "url": "https://developer.nytimes.com/"}, "20940215": {"by": "SunTzu9087", "descendants": 0, "id": 20940215, "score": 1, "time": 1568210035, "title": "As Trump Rails and Employment Slumps, Tech Jobs Still Immune", "type": "story", "url": "https://insights.dice.com/2019/09/11/tech-jobs-bls-trump-economy/"}, "20940219": {"by": "Tomte", "descendants": 0, "id": 20940219, "score": 2, "time": 1568210053, "title": "Fundamentals of Air Logic (2012)", "type": "story", "url": "http://www.hydraulicspneumatics.com/200/TechZone/PneumaticValves/Article/False/6455/TechZone-PneumaticValves"}, "20940223": {"by": "childintime", "descendants": 0, "id": 20940223, "score": 2, "time": 1568210073, "title": "Flutter 1.9 Release Notes", "type": "story", "url": "https://github.com/flutter/flutter/wiki/Release-Notes-Flutter-1.9.1"}, "20940231": {"by": "Osiris30", "descendants": 0, "id": 20940231, "score": 1, "time": 1568210102, "title": "The future of transit-oriented urban development is not retro", "type": "story", "url": "https://pedestrianobservations.com/2019/09/08/the-future-is-not-retro/"}, "20940265": {"by": "toeknee123", "descendants": 0, "id": 20940265, "score": 2, "time": 1568210288, "title": "Building an Event-Driven Pipeline in AWS Using Serverless", "type": "story", "url": "https://www.cloudforecast.io/blog/event-driven-pipeline-aws-serverless/"}, "20940269": {"by": "morenoh149", "dead": true, "id": 20940269, "score": 1, "time": 1568210307, "title": "Django import data from 3rd party API with pagination", "type": "story", "url": "https://harrymoreno.com/2019/09/10/Django-import-from-3rd-party-api-with-pagination.html"}, "20940271": {"by": "ga-vu", "descendants": 0, "id": 20940271, "score": 4, "time": 1568210311, "title": "Scientists create embryos to save northern white rhinos", "type": "story", "url": "https://phys.org/news/2019-09-scientists-embryos-northern-white-rhinos.html"}, "20940284": {"by": "JimmyFips", "descendants": 1, "id": 20940284, "kids": [20940444], "score": 3, "time": 1568210419, "title": "Email Recipient Sequencing can represent an unspoken corporate status", "type": "story", "url": "https://www.writersunknown.com/article/recipient_sequencing/"}, "20940306": {"by": "robtherobber", "descendants": 0, "id": 20940306, "score": 1, "time": 1568210538, "title": "How to Make Our Ideas Clear (1878) by Charles S.

"John Wick: Chapter 3 \u2013 Parabellum arrives on DVD, Blu-ray and priced-to-rent VOD this morning. The $75 million-budgeted Keanu Reeves action flick opened with $56 million in mid-May and legged out to $171 million domestic, +86% from its predecessor\u2019s $92 million domestic cume, which was in turn +113% from the original John Wick\u2019s $43 million domestic gross in October of 2014.<p>The threequel earned $321 million worldwide, up 86% from John Wick: Chapter Two\u2019s $172 million cume in 2017 and 3.6x the $88 million that John Wick earned in 2014. In terms of movie-to-movie growth for franchises that don\u2019t take excessive sabbaticals (sorry, Jurassic World or Mad Max: Fury Road), this was unprecedented. Can John Wick: Chapter 4 turn the franchise into an A-level worldwide blockbuster franchise?<p>It was able to jump so far from its respective predecessor twice in a row because it started small. We were talking about a film that earned as much domestically as Blake Lively\u2019s (underappreciated) Age of Adeline. It was a real breakout sequel in 2017, but the John Wick franchise didn\u2019t leap so high that there was nowhere to go but down. It wasn\u2019t Pitch Perfect, which jumped from $65 million in 2012 to $188 million in 2015 and then earned $100 million in 2017, or Austin Powers which went from $53 million to $205 million to $215 million. A bump from $43 million to $92 million is significant, especially in this environment where originals struggle and prepackaged franchise-starters play like sequels.

Unlike being an employee, you have all the freedom to take your work in any direction you choose but also all the responsibility that comes with it.<p>Every freelancer must have a solid business plan to be in and sustain a successful business. This should include a strategy for acquiring new work, a set of checks and balances to maintain a high level of quality in the work that is produced, and maintaining the appropriate funding to maintain the business. These three components are necessary to maintaining a healthy business.<p>As part of being self-employed, there must be a system developed for money management keeping track of the revenue coming in as well as what is going out. There are certain expenses that are tax deductable know them and take advantage of them.<p>Work hours are one of the leading reasons a person thinks a freelance work style is so advantageous. It is true that a freelancer gets to choose their own hours. But on the flip side, if the freelancer is not working then they are not earning any revenue. Having the freedom to choose your own hours has to be balanced with getting all of the contracts done on time, every time. If you are consistently late with assignments, you will lose your contracts. With no contracts, there is no revenue and the only choice for some is that you must go work for someone else. This is where having the discipline to stick with the long hours pays off. All of your efforts are directly related to your revenue. The more you work, the more work gets competed which is done for a payment.<p>When it comes to time off, the freelancer has the advantage of taking whenever they feel like it. Emergency situations are never a problem with a boss, because they are the boss. But this again must be balanced. A sick relative or child does have to be taken care of but just because you are a freelancer and the other members of your family are not, does not mean you carry the full weight of the responsibility. Judging what is an emergency and what must be taken care of immediately must be made. There are some that think just because you are a freelancer you can take the time off to entertain a friend when they want you to. The thing most people do not understand is that after taking a day off with work that is needed to be done, then that night will have to be an all-nighter to accomplish the needed tasks. Saying no to people about going out is necessary to make sure you get the work done on time.\nTaxes are the biggest headache of every person in the world and for a freelancer it is the same. The main difference is that instead of the government taking a portion of your salary each paycheck for taxes; it is your responsibility to set this money aside. The advantage is that you can put it into a savings account and collect interest on it until you pay the bill. This is a necessary procedure that must be taken. There are many that put off setting aside a portion of their revenue until the tax bill arrives in the spring. This has broken more freelancers than any other single thing. Proper discipline will be the difference in making it as a freelancer or not.", "time": 1573785706, "title": "Secrets About How to Become a Successful Freelancer", "type": "story"}, "21541818": {"by": "dash16", "dead": true, "id": 21541818, "score": 1, "text": "Freelancertohire is  India\u2019s best job portal where job seekers can search and apply for  Freelance jobs, Private jobs, Govt jobs online.

People who are grounded in reality are rare and may often be lost among the sea of the deluded masses( I&#x27;m one of them). So this post of mine is an attempt to gather people who are like-minded.( people who I deem to be grounded in reality through my own colored lens of the world). The idea is to form mutually beneficial alliances in this insane world. Right now this process of forming alliances is somewhat unplanned and subject to chance events(you meet&#x2F;know someone reasonable at school, work etc.). I&#x27;m hoping to cast the net wide by leveraging the internet. As to what exactly should the alliance be, or what it hopes to achieve is something to be discussed (though I have some concrete preliminary thoughts).<p>How to start: Email me your core beliefs ( though I personally prefer a voice chat with on Skype, google hangouts etc.), especially the beliefs where you think you differ fundamentally from the vast majority of people. I will quiz you on various subjects ( and so can you) to see if our beliefs align. Overall my beliefs can be loosely labeled as: generally anarchist (i.e a live and let live approach), generally anti-authoritarian ( meaning I believe govt&#x2F;authorities do not protect your interests), largely capitalist( i.e vehemently opposed to coercive co-operation, put forth by typical socialism) etc. Perhaps at the bare minimum we have to share a meta belief that it is necessary to reach out and cooperate with other like minded individuals as it is virtually impossible to &#x27;de-delude&#x27; the idiotic masses though arguments&#x2F;dialogs etc. My email address can be found on my profile. In my profile you will also find a link to some webpages that outline my beliefs.<p>After this step, if we think our beliefs align, I will add you to an an online forum ( zero people as of now) , where you can interact with other people that I will be screening.<p>Caveats:<p>-It often takes a very long time ( months to years) to form mutually beneficial alliances. ( more so when individuals are geographically isolated from each other.) This is not a quick fix for your immediate problems, or for people without perseverance.<p>-The online forum is not to rant against the world, or a place to discuss your core beliefs.
